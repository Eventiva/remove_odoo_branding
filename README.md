## Configuration

### Branding Removal

After installation, the module automatically inherits and modifies the relevant templates to remove Odoo branding. No additional configuration is required.

Some templates are marked as `active="False"` and `customize_show="True"`, which means they can be activated/customized from the technical menu if needed.

### Custom Email Footer

To add your custom email footer:

1. Go to **Settings > General Settings**
2. Scroll down to the **Email Footer** section (below Email Templates)
3. Enter your custom footer content (HTML supported)
4. Click **Save**

**Example footer content:**

```html
<p style="margin-top: 4px; font-size: 10px; color: #777;">
  <strong>Confidentiality Notice:</strong> This email and any attachments are
  confidential and may be privileged. If you are not the intended recipient,
  please notify us immediately and delete this message.
</p>
```

Your custom footer will appear in all transactional emails after the company contact details.

## Notes

- This module uses XPath inheritance to surgically remove only the branding elements from templates
- Python model overrides are used for dynamic branding (e.g., event badge printing)
- The module does not affect the functionality of any features
- Company information in email footers is preserved; only the "Powered by Odoo" text is removed
- For the event module, the badge printing sponsor text will be empty by default unless set via system parameters
